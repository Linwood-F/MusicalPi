MusicalPi - Sheet music display

This project is a Calibre-integrated, music display designed for a touch screen
on a Raspberry Pi (only tested on 3B version).

It is written in QT (version 5.5 as of this note), and dynamically linked (i.e.
you must have a working QT install as described).

The software is licensed for use under the Apache 2.0 license; QT is separately
licensed as described in their distribution.

This software is provided without any warranty or support, though I welcome comments
and contributions.

Please note that as of this writing (12/26/2016) this is a very preliminary commit
that functions, but is hardly ready for any serious use.  In particular, I have yet
to write setup and installation instructions for the Pi. There are setup instructions
for the development environment on Ubuntu 16.04 on a HyperV VM which could be used to
create a similar setup on other environments.

Music is stored as PDF's in the Calibre eBook software, and you must make the Calibre
library database visible to this program directly - this does NOT use the Calibre server
but accesses the SQLite database directly.

Poppler is used for rendering the PDF documents.

Subsequent commits will update this README as installation and configuration steps
become more stable.
