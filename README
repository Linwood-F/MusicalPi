MusicalPi - Sheet music display

****** NOTE *****  I realized I have been commiting changes to this that
                   do not match the documentation, but instead are really for
                   a next version.  I am new to Github and probably should have
                   branched or labeled or something.  The last commit at December 28
                   2016 is the one that matches the documentation.  I will try to
                   find a way to separate it clearly for a git clone.  Virtually
                   all of the changes are in the midiplay module, which you could
                   just delete/ignore.  Or try to use (note TSE3 needs to be built
                   from source to work -- the distro version will not link for
                   some entry points for reasons unclear, but the distro source
                   at launchpad (with patch also there) will work, leading me
                   to think it is a bad build that has hit the distro (both
                   intel and pi versions).

This project is a Calibre-integrated, music display designed for a touch screen
on a Raspberry Pi (only tested on 3B version).

It is written in QT (version 5.5 as of this note), and dynamically linked (i.e.
you must have a working QT install as described).

The software is licensed for use under the Apache 2.0 license; QT is separately
licensed as described in their distribution.

This software is provided without any warranty or support, though I welcome comments
and contributions.

Please refer to the Wiki on Github for installation and setup instructions:

Music is stored as PDF's in the Calibre eBook software, and you must make the Calibre
library database visible to this program directly - this does NOT use the Calibre server
but accesses the SQLite database directly.  The Calibre library could be on the Pi
as well, and you could use it for everything.  I prefer to keep my library on a
separate server, and the code as written does that, but changes are needed only in
the path constant in piconstants.h (and in the setup do not set up the cifs mount
for the server of course).

Poppler is used for rendering the PDF documents. No changes were made in Poppler.

Additional information will be added to the Wiki on Github as available.
